          <p> As the pandemic ravaged through the streets of New York City earlier this spring, many New Yorkers, following the national trend, adopted a pet to avoid spending the quarantine time alone after they were unemployed.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the reasons why individuals hesitated to adopt an animal before was because of the lack of time. COVID19, however, caused tremendous strain in the city's economy, which meant people would have more time at home.
            According to a
            report published by the
            NYtimes,
            the percentage of adoptions of animals increased by 70% throughout the U.S., when compared to the same time period last year.


            Despite the increase of animal adoptions the number of animal abuse calls made to 311 has declined in the five boroughs.

          In the months of March, April, and May— consistently with the first three months of the lockdown, the three months made up 220 of the total calls.
          While it is unclear why the rate has increased, in an article, the <a href="https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25666/20200512/covid-19-pandemic-leads-increase-animal-abuse-abandonment-heres-why.htm"> Science Times </a> noted that
          fear
          of contracting the virus from their pets led to abandonment and even poisoning of pets. Most of the complaints made to 311 however do not present details aside from the general assignations of abuse, or torture.
